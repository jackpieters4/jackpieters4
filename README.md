# Hi, I'm Jack ðŸ‘‹

I am a bioinformatician and systems biologist with a current focus on **oncology**.  
My background combines **biomedical sciences, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence**, and I enjoy working at the interface of **data-driven methods** and **translational research**.

## Academic & Research Background
- **MSc Bioinformatics & Systems Biology (VU & UvA)**  
- **BSc Liberal Arts & Sciences (AUC)**
- **Minors in Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience (UvA)** 
- Research experience across **oncology and pharmacology**, including projects on:  
  - Risk signature development from RNA-seq data.  
  - Predictive modeling of bloodâ€“brain barrier penetration for glioblastoma.

## Selected Projects
- [Segmentation and quantification of microscopy images](https://github.com/jackpieters4/Image-Processing-Quantitative-Data-Analysis)  
  MSc course Image Processing and Quantitative Data Analysis. *My role: pipeline development, feature extraction, evaluation.*
- [Python tool for molecular property (CNS-MPO) Prediction](https://github.com/jackpieters4/minor_research_project_BSB)  
  MSc Research Project . *My role: entire project*
- [Breast cancer subtype classification on transcriptomic profiles](https://github.com/jackpieters4/Bioinformatics-For-Translational-Medicine)  
  MSc course Bioinformatics for Translational Medicine. *My role: model training, performance assessment.*
- [Random Forest model for odor based on chemical structure](https://github.com/jackpieters4/Scientific-Machine-Learning)  
  MSc course Scientific Machine Learning. *My role: model training.*

## Skills
- **Programming & ML**: Python, R, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, SQL (basic)  
- **Bioinformatics & Biomedical Data**: RNA-seq, Image processing, Survival modeling, Pharmacokinetics  
- **Statistics**: Regression (linear, mixed, Cox), PCA, LASSO, Kaplanâ€“Meier, ROC  
- **Tools**: Git, R Studio, Anaconda, Mendix (data modeling & app development), ImageJ/FIJI  

## Publication
- *Social activity and cognitive decline in older residents of long-term care facilities: A cohort study.*  
  Journal of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease, 98(2), 433â€“443. DOI: [10.3233/JAD-221053](https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-221053)

## Beyond Bioinformatics
I also co-founded a creative collective in Amsterdam, organizing cultural events and producing music. This has strengthened my skills in project management, collaboration, and design thinking.
